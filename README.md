The website is easy to use. It has 4 navigation links at the top: About Me, Work, Contact Me and Resume.

In the Work section there are 5 projects. When clicking on the project, it will take you top that specific site. In the contact me section there are 5 options. My number, my email (clicking on this will take you to a new tab) and my social links which inlcude Linkedin, GitHub and Twitter. Clicking on any of the three will take you to a new tab.
